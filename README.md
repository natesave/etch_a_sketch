This project is from the foundations course from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project). This project will act like an etch-a-sketch using a grid to create different shapes through hover or clicks. The focus is to use mainly JavaScript (as much as possible) to create the grid and interactions through DOM.
